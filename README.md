# AI and Machine Learning Lecture Exercises

Welcome to the AI and Machine Learning Lecture Exercises repository! This repository contains a collection of exercise problems and trial projects designed to supplement your learning in the AI and Machine Learning lectures. Designed for the lectures at Hochschule Fresenius, KÃ¶ln, Germany

## Exercise Problems

In this section, you will find a variety of exercise problems covering different topics in AI and Machine Learning. These exercises are designed to reinforce your understanding of key concepts and algorithms discussed in the lectures. Each exercise includes a problem statement, dataset (if applicable), and solution template to guide you through the implementation.

## Trial Projects

In this section, you will find trial projects that allow you to apply the concepts learned in the lectures to real-world datasets and scenarios. These projects are more extensive and provide an opportunity to showcase your skills in AI and Machine Learning through practical applications.

### Project Examples:
- Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning
- Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews
- Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Analysis
- Autonomous Robot Navigation
- And many more...

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises and trial projects, simply clone or download this repository to your local machine. Each exercise/problem/project is organized into separate directories for easy navigation. You can choose the topics/projects that interest you the most and work through them at your own pace.
```
git clone https://github.com/aleenababy/AI-and-Machine-learning-lecture
```

## Feedback and Contributions
- Basic understanding of Python programming language.
